# USOPC Data Fellow Project

Thanks so much for having me complete this project, I had a fun time doing so. Here are all the files related to this project as well as the links to the Tableau Public Data Story for Part 1 and the YouTube Video for Part 2.

## Part 1

For Part 1 of the Project, my Data Story can be found at the following link:

Data Story: https://public.tableau.com/views/BillyFryerUSOPCDataFellowProjectPart1/DataStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

I used the following files for the following purposes during this project:

`Cleaned-Data Folder` is for the data after I cleaned it R.

`Raw-Data Folder` is for the data directly from the sources I gathered them from. A Word Doc is in that folder with links to the websites I got the data from.

`Billy Fryer USOPC Data Fellow Project Part 1.twb` is the Tableau Workbook that I created my Data Story and Dashboard in.

`Create-General-Info-Data.R` file is where I aggregated the data to go in the Quick Facts section of the Dashboard (General Info was the developmental name for this section)

`Create-Map-Data.R` file is where I aggregated the data for the map visualization in the bottom right portion of the dashboard.

`Create-Master-Table.R` is where I initially combined all of my data together before breaking it apart into smaller data sets that were better for the visualizations I wanted to create.

`Create-Medal-Data.R` is where I aggregated the data for the Medal Table chart showing the combined medals from Lima 2019, Tokyo 2020, and Beijing 2022.

`Create-Pie-Data.R` is where I compiled information about the High Performance Programs for the "Funding by High Performance Programs" visualization. As the name suggests, the original idea was to create a Pie Chart with this information, but I ended up selected a different way of displaying this data.

`Create-Similar-NGBs-Data.R` is where I found the common NGBS used in the table in the center of the Dashboard.

`USOPC-2023.Rproj` is the R Project File I used to help with data paths and keep my workflow contained.

Finally, the `athlete_training_facility_data.csv+"... file was necessary for uploading my Data Story to Tableau Public

## Part 2

For Part 2 of the Project, I uploaded a video to YouTube explaining concepts behind Data Structuring or relating datasets to one another. The link for the YouTube video is below
